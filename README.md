# Automotive Analytics in C++

Welcome to the **Automotive Analytics** project! This C++ application provides a deep dive into automotive data, enabling detailed analysis of used cars from a given dataset. The project demonstrates the use of dynamic arrays, operator overloading, and basic CSV parsing techniques in C++.

## Project Overview

In this assignment, you will work with a dataset containing detailed information about used cars. The goal is to read the data from a CSV file, store it in a dynamic array, and implement operator overloading to analyze different types of cars.

### Dataset Columns

The dataset includes the following columns:
1. `name` - Car name
2. `dateCrawled` - Date when the ad was first seen
3. `seller type` - Private or dealer
4. `offer type` - Offer type
5. `price` - Selling price
6. `A/B testing information` - A/B testing data
7. `vehicle type` - Type of vehicle
8. `year of registration` - Year the car was registered
9. `gearbox type` - Gearbox type
10. `power output in PS` - Horsepower
11. `model of car` - Car model
12. `how many kilometers has it driven so far` - Kilometers driven
13. `month of registration` - Month the car was registered
14. `fuel type utilized by it` - Fuel type (petrol/diesel/electricity/lpg)
15. `brand name` - Car brand
16. `notRepairedDamage` - Whether the car has unrepaired damage
17. `DateCreated` - Date when the ad was created
18. `nrofpictures` - Number of pictures included with the ad
19. `postalcode` - Area code where the car was posted
20. `lastSeen` - Last time the post was scanned

### Your Task

1. **Read Data**: Read the details from a CSV file.
2. **Dynamic Array**: Store the data in a dynamic array.
3. **Operator Overloading**: Implement operator overloading for different types of cars.

### Tools and Restrictions

- **Structures**: Use C++ structures to define the car data.
- **Libraries**: Only use libraries for reading and writing operations. Avoid using other C++ standard libraries.
- **No STL**: Avoid using STL containers and advanced libraries.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automotive-analytics-cpp.git
